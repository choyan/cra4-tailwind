# cra4-tailwind
This packaged is bootstrapped with Create React App, TailwindCSS, Husky, Prettier and Zustand

# Installation
Follow the simple instruction
```
git clone https://github.com/choyan/cra-tailwind-ts.git
yarn
```


## Extra Note
Create React App doesn't let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, we also need to install CRACO to be able to configure Tailwind. (Note from Tailwind Doc)
